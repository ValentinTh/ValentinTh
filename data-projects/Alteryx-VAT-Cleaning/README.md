# Goal of this project

VAT is a key data in companies. Thoses numbers need to be crushed down and treated.

# Context

We are like any consultant taking datasheets and transforming them as needed to get the data right, purified and effective.
Using Alteryx to make it the best way possible and extract it.

# The data

The dataset is a tax transformation piece and contains customers, types of VAT percentages, origins, currencies, etc.
For obvious reasons it will not be shared here.

# Some visualisations
