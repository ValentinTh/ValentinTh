# Goal of this project

Take the mystery out of big data and learn what itâ€™s like to produce business results with the KPMG data analytics team.
All the tasks that a data analyst consultant would do with tools such as Excel, PowerPoint and Power BI.

# Context

We have 3 datasets provided by our customer, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, which is looking to improve the customer base and to target data issues and generate insights.

Separated in 3 steps :
- Data Analysis & Preparation (Filtering, Formating, Cleaning on Excel, Results Communication)
- Data Insights & Modeling (Data Analytics, Customer Segmentation, Data Driven Presentations)
- Data & Visualisation (Dashboarding on Power BI, Data Visualization)

# The data

The dataset is a group of CSV files extracted from the customer's CRM. We have to deal with inconsistent data and to transform it.

# Some visualisations
